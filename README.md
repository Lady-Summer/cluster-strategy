# Cluster Strategy
# Introduction
For cloud platform, providing elastic resource management is a main trend. But each cloud service provider has different SDK/API to operate remote cloud compute clusters in a more complicated way. So this project aims to provide a series of uniform interfaces that can create/delete/add/destroy cloud cluster of any cloud service provider like AliCloud, TencentCloud in an easier way.

You can operate a cluster with a more elastic way. Such project can be part of your DevOps evolution and organization.

# Features 
1. It can be integrated with any system needs remote cloud compute pool simply by RESTful API.
2. Creating a cluster with any number of nodes with configurations you want and payment modes.
3. Supporting Dockernization, cloud native framework.
4. Operating cluster in an elastic way. However, it isn't responsible for your applications' stability and extensibility.
5. SpringBoot project in *Scala*, easy deploying and maintaining.
